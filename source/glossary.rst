   client
      A client is a software application that accesses a service made
      available by a server. The server is often (but not always) on another
      computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of
      a network. The term applies to programs or devices that are part of a
      client–server model. `Wikipedia Client <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)>`_

   connection
      A connection is relationship between clients and servers that use a
      connection-oriented protocol to exchange data.  In this specification a
      connection is used to establish a session, which is an agreement between
      the client and server that the connection will be a specific kind of
      relationship.

   cryptographic hash function
      A hash function is any function that can be used to map digital data of
      arbitrary size to digital data of fixed size. The values returned by a
      hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply
      hashes.
      
      A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which is considered
      practically impossible to invert, that is, to recreate the input data
      from its hash value alone.  `Wikipedia Hash Function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function>`_

   network emulation
      Network emulation is a technique where the properties of a network are
      simulated using emulation of network equipment (i.e., OSI Layer 2).  This
      is distinguished from network simulation which includes simplified
      mathematical models of a physical network (i.e., OSI Layer 1).

   server
      A server is a software application that is capable of accepting requests
      from clients. The clients are often (but not always) on another
      computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of
      a network. The term applies to programs or devices that are part of a
      client–server model. `Wikipedia Server <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)>`_

   session
      A session is a semi-permanent interactive information interchange, also
      known as a dialogue, a conversation or a meeting, between a client and
      a server.  Different types of sessions have different expectations of
      the kinds of messages that will be used in the session.

   connection-oriented protocol
      A connection-oriented protocol provides a reliable network service
      between clients and servers that includes delivery of packets in the
      same order they were sent, acknowledgment after successful delivery, and
      automatic repeat request functions in case of missing data or detected
      bit-errors.
